[ðŸ”— Live Demo](https://knowledge-graph-generator-project.onrender.com/)

This web application extracts key entities and relationships from user input in the form of **Text**, **PDF**, or **URL**, and generates an interactive **Knowledge Graph**. It utilizes advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **spaCy**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, and **dependency parsing**.

---

## Features

- Accepts input from:
  - Plain text
  - PDF file upload
  - URL of a web page
- Extracts:
  - Named Entities (Person, Organization, Location, etc.)
  - Contextual relationships
- Visualizes data as an interactive **Knowledge Graph**
- Displays structured **JSON output** of extracted entities
- Deployed on [Render](https://render.com/)

## Use Cases

- Educational tools for learning NLP & Knowledge Representation
- Semantic search and contextual web crawling
- Preprocessing pipeline for knowledge-based AI systems
- Research visualization

##  How It Works

1. **User Input**: Accepts either raw text, a PDF file, or a URL.
2. **Processing**:
   - Cleans and parses the input
   - Extracts named entities and syntactic dependencies using **spaCy**
   - Forms relations and connections between entities
3. **Output**:
   - Visualized interactive graph
   - Downloadable or viewable JSON format
